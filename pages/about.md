My name is Guy Levin, and my nickname since childhood has been "Guy what a Guy", so I decided to call my blog after that.

My computer science passion started when I was 13, but probably not the way you think. It was a lazy afternoon and I decided to build a rocket engine. However, on its first test it prematurely fired and exploded in my face. A burned nose and lost eyelashes led me to stay at home until my face healed. Bored and with no spare rocket engine parts, I decided to branch into computer science (less physically dangerous, hopefully).

I taught myself how to program, then how to break programs, and in high school I hacked my country's national grading system. After graduating, I served in the IDF's SIGINT [Unit 8200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_8200), and right now I am a student at [Stanford University](https://profiles.stanford.edu/guy-levin).
