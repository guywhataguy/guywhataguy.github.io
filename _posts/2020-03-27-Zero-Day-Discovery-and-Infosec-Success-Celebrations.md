With the world in quarantine and isolation because of COVID\-19, I decided to publish a blog post reminding us of more cheerful times.

Take yourself back to the last time you spent weeks hammering away at a seemingly impossible challenge, and quickly fast\-forward to when you finished that problem.

Do you remember your intense excitement and satisfaction? How did you celebrate your success?

**I asked security researchers how they celebrate finding 0days, APTs in the wild, new malware, and other big successes. Here are the results.**
### Thomas Roth [@StackSmashing](https://twitter.com/StackSmashing)
*Founder of [leveldown](https://leveldown.de/), co\-founder of [keylabsio](http://keylabs.io/)*
> "I once had a celebratory cake for an 0day
>
> otherwise I tend to \[celebrate\] with a nice beer in the evening :\)"

### Ned Williamson [@NedWilliamson](https://twitter.com/NedWilliamson)
*iOS Hacker, formerly 3DS/Chrome Hacking*
> "I like fashion, so sometimes if I find a really big bug I'll buy something I was saving to get. But these days I don't do that as much. I'm mostly disconnected from the ups and downs of finding results since that's just better for my mental health. The journey is the reward :\)"

### Shahar Tal [@Jifa](https://twitter.com/Jifa)
*VP Research, Security Research Labs at Cellebrite*
> "Every success has its own due celebration. I wouldnâ€™t say thereâ€™s a winning format.
Sometimes we join to toast with Whiskey, sometimes we go out for \[street food\] :\)
Iâ€™m open to celebratory 0day choreography if you have any dance suggestions."

### Stalmans [@\_staaldraad](https://twitter.com/_staaldraad)
*Senior Security Engineer, Product Security at Heroku*
> "There is the immediate celebration when that "itch" pays off or the exploit chain comes together. That is usually a bunch of shouting and then rapidly trying to explain it all to my wife. Then depending on how tough it was \(or how tired I am\) it is either celebratory take\-out from our favorite place or going out for a great dinner."

### Brandon Falk [@gamozolabs](https://twitter.com/gamozolabs)
*Security Researcher at Gamozo Labs*

### Yarden Shafir [@yarden\_shafir](https://twitter.com/yarden_shafir)

## Reflection
I believe celebrating success healthy praises our hard earned winning moments,  which balance out the inevitable occasional shortcomings on the "roller  coaster" of research \(and life\). I sincerely enjoyed  learning each researcher's celebratory tradition because it brought out his or her unique and  interesting character, even though I didn't publish everyone's response. Furthermore, I wholly encourage following each of the security researchers mentioned on Twitter \- I personally enjoy their tweets and the interesting research they publish.

I hope I managed to slightly brighten your day and maybe even remind you of more joyful times to help you get through this tough period.
