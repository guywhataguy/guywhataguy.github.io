In this post I list all the popular vulnerability research and reverse engineering tools. In each category I first listed the tool(s) I personally use, and then followed with alternatives. Pirating software *is* illegal, but all of the payed programs can be found on pirate websites ;).

## Disassemblers and Reverse Engineering Tools
Disassemblers decode machine instructions in binary into their readable assembly representation. The following programs have evolved beyond simple disassembly to become full platforms for reverse engineering with features such as custom symbol naming, graphically viewing code flow, and listing references in the assembly to functions and data. The more advanced tools also support decompilation which is the process of converting the assembly into higher level code such as C or C\+\+.

## Debuggers
Debuggers are very helpful in dynamically analyzing the flow of a program, and equally helpful in debugging an exploit.
* 
### WinDbg 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\windbg+debugger+logo.png" caption="" alt="windbg logo" %}
* Free but closed source. Can be download from the [Microsoft Store](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9PGJGD53TN86) or with the [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)
* By far the most powerful windows debugger on the list.
* Very steep learning curve
* I recommend [this](http://www.zachburlingame.com/wp-content/uploads/fec46d7fc976_C835/windbg.reg) theme \(there is no easy way to import themes except .reg files\)
* My personal favorite Windows debugger
* Available for Windows

* 
### GDB 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\gdb+logo.png" caption="" alt="gnu gdb fish logo" %}
* Free and opensource ðŸ™‚ . Can be downloaded with "apt\-get install gdb"
* Relatively steep learning curve because of command line interface
* I recommend downloading the [pwndbg](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) extension to have better colors and more features
* My personal favorite Linux debugger
* Available for MAC, Linux and Windows

* 
### OllyDbg 

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\olly+dbg+logo.png" caption="" alt="olydbg logo" %}
* Free and opensource ðŸ™‚. Can be downloaded [here](http://www.ollydbg.de/download.htm)
* The most gradual learning curve
* Available for Windows


## Executable Analysis Tools
The following tools are helpful to get a glimpse on executable internals, when opening a full reverse engineering platform such as IDA would be overkill.
* 
### CFF Explorer

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\cff_explorer_logo.png" caption="" alt="cff explorer logo" %}
* Free and opensource ðŸ™‚. Can be downloaded from [here](http://www.ntcore.com/files/ExplorerSuite.exe)
* Easy to use GUI
* Available for Windows 

* 
### GNU ELF utils

* Great when looking for a lightweight interface
* Available for MAC, Linux and Windows


## Documentation
This is sometimes overlooked, but it's **so** important. For example do you remember how snprintf behaves on windows when input is too long? does\_snprintf behave the same way? The answer is that it doesn't and that's why it's [handy to have documentation around](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/snprintf-snprintf-snprintf-l-snwprintf-snwprintf-l?view=vs-2019#return-value).
* 
### MSDN

{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\msdn+logo.png" caption="" alt="msdn logo" %}
* For everything Microsoft related

* 
### Linux MAN pages 
{% include image.html url="/assets/img/posts\man+man+page.png" caption="" alt="manpage for man" %}

* For everything UNIX related


As usual, if I missed anything let me know :P
