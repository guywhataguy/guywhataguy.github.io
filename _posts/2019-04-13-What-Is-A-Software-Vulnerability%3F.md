## Overview

In the broadest sense, a software  vulnerability is a flaw that allows the vulnerable system to perform  *unplanned actions*. Examples of the results of these unplanned actions include, sensitive information disclosure [\(example\)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0588), denial of service \(DOS\) [\(example\)](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-vsms-dos), authentication bypass [\(example\)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17153), and most dangerously, full takeover of a system \(aka RCE\) [\(example\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2015/ms15-093) by a malicious attacker. 
## Formal Definitions
According to ENISA \(European Union Agency for Network and Information Security\) a vulnerability is, "*The existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can lead to an unexpected, undesirable event" \(*[reference](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/glossary#G52)\).

According to NICCS \(National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers & Studies\) a vulnerability is, "*Characteristic of location or security posture or of design, security  procedures, internal controls, or the implementation of any of these  that permit a threat or hazard to occur*" \([reference](https://niccs.us-cert.gov/about-niccs/glossary#V)\).

The definition I use defines a vulnerability as, "*an unintended "feature" (bug) that leads to unintended functionality.*" With this definition, any bug is a vulnerability. However a bug is only a *relevant* vulnerability if it has security consequences.

A bug in a website that displays the wrong color text is not a relevant vulnerability because wrong colors don't risk anything (except aesthetics). On the other hand, a bug in a website that doesn't limit login attempts is a vulnerability since this can be used to guess user passwords rapidly and that has security implications. 
## Vulnerability Tracking
Vulnerabilities are referenced and tracked by their CVE number, and some are infamous enough to get their own name and logo, for example, [meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)). 
## Vulnerability Consequences 
Vulnerabilities can result in [sensitive information disclosure](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-0588), [denial of service \(DOS\)](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-vsms-dos), [authentication bypass](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17153), and most dangerously, [full takeover of a system \(RCE\)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2015/ms15-093) by a malicious attacker. 
# Vulnerability Types
Vulnerabilities can be organized into 2 major classes:
## Design Vulnerabilities
This class of vulnerabilities exploit a concept in the design of a system. Meaning, there is no programmer that could implement a program with a design vulnerability in such a way that the vulnerability won't exist.

Examples of these vulnerabilities can be seen in cryptographic programs \- for example a cipher can have a flaw, and no matter in which language you use to implement the cipher, or which programmer writes the code, the program will always have this flaw \(and therefore the vulnerability\).

## Implementation Vulnerabilities
This class of vulnerabilities exploit the implementation of a system. Meaning, if the program were written differently, the bug/vulnerability would not exist. 

Many implementation vulnerabilities stem from unsafe memory usage. For example, when code moves user controlled input into a buffer that isn't big enough, the buffer is overflown, causing a "buffer overflow" and overwriting memory after the buffer. If the memory after the buffer holds for example a variable saving if the user has successfully authenticated, an attacker can overwrite this value and use the vulnerability to bypass authentication.
